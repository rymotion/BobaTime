## Description:
    ### This application is just a hypothetical app for ordering and customizing your boba tea drinks. Inspired by other apps like Philz Coffee.

## Instuctions:
    ### Use the `.yaml` provided nothing other that that is required.
    ### Designed for everyone and every device (I would recommend an OLED smartphone or for those that have it the Nexbit Robin)

    ### Usage for commercial purposes: Ask first please cause I got bills to pay. [email](mailto:rymotion1@me.com)
