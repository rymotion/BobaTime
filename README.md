# It's Boba Time

made with ❤️ Ryan Paglinawan

## Description:
This application is just a hypothetical app for ordering and customizing your boba tea drinks. Inspired by other apps like Philz Coffee, and sitting in a boba shop wondering if it would be possible to make something that would allow you to order boba and customize it.
